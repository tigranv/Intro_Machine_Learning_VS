In this repository, I gathered a lot of useful examples that I create while studying machine learning. Here you can find examples of **Supervised **, **Unsupervised **, **Neural Networks**,  etc.

## Fundamentals of ML and Supervised Learning

### **Classification Models**

* [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/tigranv/Intro_Machine_Learning_VS/tree/master/UdacityIntroToML/NaiveBayes) 

### Regression Models 
### Trees, Ensemble Methods
 
## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering
### Dimensionality Reduction

## Neural Networks

### Neural Networks and Backpropagation
### Convolutional Neural Networks
### Recurrent Neural Networks
